# Convo - An AI powered app to help people network

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How it was built

This was built using React, a decision tree, Node, Express and IBM Watson

## How it works

This is a prototype version which allows people to talk to Samantha with pre-defined messages. The premise is that you are seeking to have your first networking chat at a conference.

You get two choices for the messages and each will be stored as you click through them. I give you some commentary and IBM Watson gives a tone of voice indicator.

You can make 3 choices for this prototype.


## Bugs

- Watson is picky about the choices you make and will only give feedback on longer statements


## Wishlist
- A CRUD system that stores previous choices
- A chat system that can take any messages, not pre-defined
